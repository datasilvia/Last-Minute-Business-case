    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annual plans ensure stable income**: They reduce monthly cancellations and offer predictable income.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher average income per customer**: Price increases increase the income if there is no significant drop in customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attract new customers with annual discounts**: Encourage higher value subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Negatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss of price-sensitive customers**: A monthly increase could anger some users, and even cause them to cancel their subscription..\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Liquidity problems**: Annual plans change the constant monthly flow for less frequent payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High upfront costs**: Discounts and marketing campaigns for annual plans can reduce short-term benefits.\n"
